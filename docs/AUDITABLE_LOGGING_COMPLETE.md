## üìù Next Steps for You

### Immediate (Required):

1. **Run Database Migration**
   ```
   Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor ‚Üí Run migration SQL
   ```
   
2. **Test the Features**
   - Create a new incident
   - Try both contemporaneous and retrospective entry types
   - Amend an existing incident
   - View the revision history

### Optional:

3. **Run Backfill Script** (if desired)
   ```bash
   npm run backfill:auditable-logs
   ```

4. **Review Documentation**
   - Read the specification
   - Share with team/stakeholders
   - Update internal procedures

## üéì Training Your Team

### Key Points to Communicate:

1. **"If it ain't written down, it didn't happen"**
   - Every decision must be logged
   - Logs are legal documents

2. **Real-time vs Retrospective**
   - Default is always "Contemporaneous"
   - Use "Retrospective" only when necessary
   - Always justify delayed entries

3. **Factual Logging Only**
   - No opinions or adjectives
   - Include who, what, where, when
   - Stick to verifiable facts

4. **Amendments, Not Edits**
   - Original values are preserved
   - Every change is tracked
   - Always provide a reason

## üìà Success Metrics

Monitor these metrics to ensure system adoption:

- **Contemporaneous vs Retrospective Ratio**: Target <2% retrospective
- **Amendment Frequency**: Monitor for unusual patterns
- **Time Delta**: Average time between occurrence and logging
- **Justification Quality**: Review retrospective justifications

## üí¨ Need Help?

### Common Questions:

**Q: Do I need to use retrospective for every delayed entry?**  
A: Only if there's a significant delay (>15 minutes) from when the incident occurred.

**Q: Can I delete a log entry?**  
A: No. Logs are immutable. If incorrect, create an amendment explaining the correction.

**Q: Will this slow down logging?**  
A: No. The default flow is identical. New fields are automatically populated.

**Q: What if I forget to mark as retrospective?**  
A: You'll see a warning message. You can still submit, but it's recommended to mark correctly.
