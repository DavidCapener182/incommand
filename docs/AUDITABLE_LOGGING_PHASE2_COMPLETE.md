## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Real-Time Update Flow

```
User A Creates Amendment
        ↓
API: /api/v1/incidents/[id]/amend
        ↓
Database: incident_log_revisions INSERT
        ↓
Supabase Real-Time: Broadcast to all clients
        ↓
        ├── User B: IncidentTable → Toast notification
        ├── User C: IncidentDetailsModal → Auto-refresh
        └── User D: useLogRevisions → Revision count update
```

### Multi-Channel Subscriptions

**Channel 1: Event-Wide Incident Logs**
```typescript
channel(`incident_logs_${eventId}`)
  .on('*', 'incident_logs', filter: `event_id=eq.${eventId}`)
```
- Handles: All incident CRUD operations
- Used by: IncidentTable
- Notifications: New incidents, amendments, status changes

**Channel 2: Log Revisions**
```typescript
channel(`log_revisions_${eventId}`)
  .on('INSERT', 'incident_log_revisions')
```
- Handles: New revision creation
- Used by: useLogRevisions hook
- Notifications: Field changes, amendments

**Channel 3: Individual Incident**
```typescript
channel(`incident_${incidentId}_${timestamp}`)
  .on('UPDATE', 'incident_logs', filter: `id=eq.${incidentId}`)
  .on('INSERT', 'incident_log_revisions', filter: `incident_log_id=eq.${incidentId}`)
```
- Handles: Specific incident updates
- Used by: IncidentDetailsModal
- Notifications: Auto-refresh on any change
