## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Service Worker Architecture
- **Base**: Auto-generated service worker from next-pwa
- **Enhancement**: Custom push notification handlers
- **Features**: Background sync, offline support, error handling

### Push Notification Flow
1. **Registration**: Service worker registers with push manager
2. **Subscription**: User subscribes to push notifications
3. **Storage**: Subscription saved to `push_subscriptions` table
4. **Sending**: Server sends push messages using VAPID keys
5. **Receiving**: Service worker handles push events
6. **Display**: Notifications shown to user
7. **Interaction**: Click handling and navigation

### Camera & GPS Integration
- **Camera**: Device API integration with fallback to file upload
- **GPS**: Geolocation API with accuracy validation
- **Offline**: Queued incident creation with sync on reconnection
- **Metadata**: Photo and location data attached to incidents

### Database Design
- **Security**: Row Level Security for user data isolation
- **Performance**: Indexed queries for fast lookups
- **Integrity**: Foreign key constraints and triggers
- **Scalability**: Efficient schema for high-volume usage

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Generate VAPID Keys**:
   ```bash
   npm run generate-vapid
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
   VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
   ```

3. **Run Database Migration**:
   - Execute `database/push_subscriptions_migration.sql` in Supabase

4. **Test Implementation**:
   - Start development server
   - Navigate to notification settings
   - Test push notification flow

### Production Deployment
1. **Environment Variables**: Add VAPID keys to production environment
2. **Database Migration**: Run migration on production database
3. **Service Worker**: Ensure service worker is properly deployed
4. **HTTPS**: Verify HTTPS is enabled (required for push notifications)
5. **Testing**: Test push notifications in production environment
