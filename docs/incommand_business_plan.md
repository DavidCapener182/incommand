# InCommand AI Business Plan

## 1. Executive Summary

InCommand is a bootstrapped, AI-native event control platform that equips live event operators—stadiums, festivals, production teams, and municipal safety units—with a single dashboard for situational awareness, coordination, and compliance. By combining multi-tenant event management, incident tracking, AI-generated insights, and real-time communications, the product resolves fragmentation that slows response times and inflates operational costs.

**Mission:** Deliver actionable intelligence that empowers every event control room to operate safer, faster, and with complete confidence.

**Vision:** Become the global operating system for large-scale events, orchestrating proactive safety, sustainability, and guest experience outcomes across venues and cities.

**Strategic Goals:**
- **0–6 months:** Launch production-ready MVP, close six lighthouse customers, and validate a 25% incident response-time reduction through pilot analytics.
- **6–18 months:** Expand to 30 enterprise venues, integrate advanced predictive analytics and sustainability metrics, and achieve $1.2M ARR.
- **18–36 months:** Internationalize product with multilingual support, secure 150 venues, and introduce AI-assisted automation for staffing and emergency playbooks.

AI is embedded throughout InCommand: predictive analytics forecast incident hotspots, AI-powered chat supports control room operators, automated debrief reports distill learnings, and carousel insights highlight emerging risks in real time. These capabilities differentiate InCommand from static dashboards by turning raw data into prescriptive action.

## 2. Market Analysis

### Industry Overview
- **Market Size:** Global event management software surpassed $7.6B in 2023 with a projected ~14% CAGR through 2030, while the crowd management and event security segment is a $3B+ adjacency experiencing heightened investment.
- **Growth Drivers:** Increased frequency of large-scale events, post-pandemic safety regulations, demand for operational transparency, and proliferation of IoT sensors and computer vision in venues.
- **Technology Adoption:** Venues are modernizing tech stacks with Supabase-like databases, AI copilots, and cloud-native dashboards; however, data remains siloed across ticketing, radio logs, weather feeds, and incident reporting tools.

### Target Market & Pain Points
- **Customer Segments:** Stadiums and arenas, outdoor festivals, convention centers, collegiate athletics, city event bureaus, and professional security contractors.
- **Primary Challenges:** Fragmented communication, lagging situational awareness, manual compliance reporting, difficulty predicting crowd surges, limited staffing coordination, and insufficient analytics for ROI justification.

### Market Needs & AI Value
- Unified command center aggregating incidents, staff assignments, AI chat history, and predictive KPIs.
- Real-time notifications with deduplication, priority animations, and auto-refresh to maintain control room focus.
- AI-generated debriefs and insights delivering immediate post-event reporting without manual spreadsheet work.
- Predictive analytics forecasting incident types, crowd density, and resource requirements using historical and live data feeds.
- Secure, multi-tenant architecture enabling vendors to manage multiple clients without cross-tenant data leakage.

### Competitor Analysis
| Competitor | Capabilities | Gaps | InCommand Advantage |
|------------|--------------|------|----------------------|
| Everbridge, AlertMedia | Mass notification & critical event management | Limited event-specific workflows and post-event analytics | End-to-end event lifecycle coverage with AI debriefs, incident heatmaps, and staff coordination |
| CrowdVision, WaitTime | Camera-based crowd density analysis | Narrow scope, lacks incident logging & communications | Combines predictive crowd analytics with operational orchestration and messaging |
| VenueOps, Ungerboeck | Venue management suites | Focused on scheduling and CRM, minimal real-time AI | Adds AI copilot, live notifications, and predictive operations atop core scheduling data |
| Custom control rooms | Hardware-intensive bespoke builds | Expensive, slow to implement, limited AI automation | Software-first, hardware agnostic, rapid deployment with Supabase backend |

### Emerging Trends
- **AI Automation:** Shift toward prescriptive recommendations and AI copilots assisting dispatch and incident closure.
- **IoT & Edge Integration:** Sensor fusion (BLE beacons, CCTV, weather stations) streaming into dashboards such as InCommand’s KPI grids and heatmaps.
- **Predictive Analytics:** Machine learning modeling for crowd flow, staffing optimization, and incident probability, aligning with InCommand’s predictive modules.
- **Real-time Crowd Data Tracking:** Combining ticket scans, location data, and radio chatter to maintain occupancy awareness.
- **Sustainability & ESG Reporting:** Events seeking carbon and waste transparency; AI-driven analytics can surface sustainability insights post-event.
