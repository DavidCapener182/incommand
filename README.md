- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini, Perplexity AI
- **Deployment**: Vercel with automatic GitHub integration
- **External APIs**: Weather, Geocoding, What3Words integration

## AI Architecture

- OpenAI primary (server). If unavailable, server responds with `fallback: 'browser-recommended'` and the client performs WebLLM parsing. WebLLM is not initialized on the server.

Additional details:
- OpenAI is the primary AI provider for server-side parsing. If the server cannot use OpenAI (e.g., missing key or outage), the endpoint responds with a fallback signal and minimal heuristics.
- When this occurs, the server includes `fallback: 'browser-recommended'` in the JSON. The client then initializes WebLLM and performs parsing locally in the browser.
- WebLLM is a browser-only runtime and is intentionally not initialized on the server.

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and configure:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_weather_api_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_WHAT3WORDS_API_KEY=your_what3words_api_key
   # Optional: configure the browser LLM model used by WebLLM (defaults to a small, browser-friendly model)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBLLM_MODEL_ID=Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-q4f32_1-MLC
   ```

   - Optional: Local LLM (Ollama) configuration if you want server-side fallback to a local model
     ```
     OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
     OLLAMA_MODEL_DEFAULT=llama3.2
     OLLAMA_MODEL_DEBRIEF=llama3.2
     OLLAMA_MODEL_SENTIMENT=llama3.2
     # OLLAMA_API_KEY=  # only if using a remote Ollama server requiring auth
     ```

3. **Run the development server**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Build for production**
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```
