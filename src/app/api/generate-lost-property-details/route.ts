Additional context:
Location: ${location || 'Not specified'}
Callsign: ${callsign || 'Not specified'}

Please provide:
1. An occurrence description that:
   - Uses the EXACT information from the input
   - Maintains all key details about the lost item
   - Formats it professionally but does not add or remove information
   - Prefix with "Lost Property: " followed by the item description
2. A professional action taken statement that reflects:
   - If item found/collected: "Item collected and logged"
   - If referred to Lost Property Office: "Directed to Lost Property Desk"
   - If item not found: "Details taken – item not yet recovered"
   - Default: "Lost property report created, awaiting update"

Format the response as JSON with 'occurrence' and 'actionTaken' fields. The occurrence MUST contain the actual situation described in the input.

Example format:
Input: "Response 1 – guest lost phone near toilets by Main Bar"
{
  "occurrence": "Lost Property: Mobile phone reported missing near toilets by Main Bar",
  "actionTaken": "Details taken – item not yet recovered. Area being checked by security team."
}`;
