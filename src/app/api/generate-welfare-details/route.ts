Additional context:
Location: ${location || 'Not specified'}
Callsign: ${callsign || 'Not specified'}

Please provide:
1. An occurrence description that:
   - Uses the EXACT information from the input
   - Maintains all key details about the person's condition
   - Formats it professionally but does not add or remove information
   - Do NOT prefix with "Welfare:" - just describe the situation directly
2. A professional action taken statement that reflects:
   - Initial welfare response
   - Any referrals made (medical, safeguarding, etc.)
   - Support provided or refused
   - Follow-up actions

Format the response as JSON with 'occurrence' and 'actionTaken' fields. The occurrence MUST contain the actual situation described in the input.

Example format:
Input: "Response 5 â€“ intoxicated female, confused and sitting alone, safeguarding concern"
{
  "occurrence": "Intoxicated female identified at Response 5 location, confused and sitting alone. Safeguarding concern raised.",
  "actionTaken": "Welfare team attending. Individual assessed and safeguarding team notified. Ongoing monitoring in place."
